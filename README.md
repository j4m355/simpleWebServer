#Simple Web Server

A simple webserver built using express ideal for development.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Git clone into each project you want a webserver for...

    cd simpleWebServer
    npm install
    node server.js
    (optionally you can pass in a port number eg node server.js 3000)

Uses a random port beween 8000 and 99999 - so you can run multiple sites from their own respective code folder

#Potential Future Changes

	Considering allowing the passing in of a port when starting
	Considering including node_modules since it is small and will be easier to run than having to type npm install each time
